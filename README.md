# AutoMagical-WebServer
A skeleton Node/Express web server that automagically accepts web-requests on URIs dynamically generated from "plug-and-play" controller modules. A great starting point for RESTful newbs and casual DIY-ers. Inspired by Dan Wahlin's Pluralsight course: Integrating Angular with Node.js RESTful Services.
